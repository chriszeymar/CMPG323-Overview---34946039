# CMPG323-Overview  -34946039

#**Description:**

In compilation of a portfolio of evidence, I will not develop a large complex project but rather an agile adaptable approach. Each project submission will consist of a independent console application system in different  programming language as we progress.

The following schedule has been established:

|Description       |Content            |Tech             |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
Project 1|Banking system|JAVA OOP
Project 2|Truck4Hire|C++
Project 3| |  
Project 4| |  
Project 5| |  

#**Repository**

The overall repository will serve as the foundation of the project and will contain most of the project administration info. The development approach requires that each project is comprised in its own repository. A repository will be created for eacvh project submission to satisfy development agility.

#**Branching:**

Along with the overall repository, an initial main branch is created. It will serve as the parent node. Each project submission will be a sub-branch to this and a central node in its independent devoplopment.

Each project submission will consist of mainly **3 branches: main, dev and hot** 

**main:** this branch consit of the initial source code. README file adjustment is made at this level

**devOps:** All coding development is done at this level. Once code has been reviewed. A request is made to merge into main

**hotFix:** Later recalibration of systems is tested/
implemted through a hot fix branch
