# CMPG323-Overview  -34946039

**Description:**

In compilation of a portfolio of evidence, I will not develop a large complex project but rather an agile adaptable approach. Each project submission will consist of a independent console application system in different  programming language as we progress.

The following schedule has been established:

|Description       |Content            |Tech             |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
Project 1|Banking system|JAVA OOP
Project 2|Truck4Hire|C++
Project 3| |  
Project 4| |  
Project 5| |  

**Repository**

The overall repository will serve as the foundation of the project and will contain most of the project administration info. The development approach requires that each project is comprised in its own repository. A repository will be created for eacvh project submission to satisfy development agility.

**Branching:**

Along with the overall repository, an initial main branch is created. It will serve the parent node. Each project submission will be a sub-branch to this and a central node in its independent devoplopment.
A branch named "develop" is used througout the project to build these systems.

A branch "flair" is used to implement updates and recalibrations.
