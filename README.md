# CMPG323-Overview  -34946039

#**Description:**

In compilation of a portfolio of evidence, I will not develop a large complex project but rather an agile adaptable approach. Each project submission will consist of a independent console application system in different  programming language as we progress.

The following schedule has been established:

|Description       |Content            |Tech             |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
Project 1|Banking system|JAVA OOP
Project 2|API Development|.NET
Project 3|WebAPP | .NET
Project 4| Robotic Proccess | Automation|  
Project 5| Reporting | Power BI  

#**Repository**

The overall repository will serve as the foundation of the project and will contain most of the project administration info. The development approach requires that each project is comprised in its own repository. A repository will be created for each project submission to satisfy development agility.

#**Branching:**

Along with the overall repository, an initial main branch is created. It will serve as the parent node. Each project submission will be a sort of a sub branch to this and a central node in its independent devoplopment.The project will contain their own autonomous branching submission as explained below.

Each project submission will consist of mainly **3 branches: main, dev and hot** 

**main:** this branch consit of the initial source code. README file adjustment is made at this level

**devOps:** All coding development is done at this level. Once code has been reviewed. A request is made to merge into main

**hotFix:** Later recalibration of systems is tested/
implemted through a hot fix branch

#**git credentials**

GCM(git credential manger) is the way wwe will usr to store credentials securely and connect to GitHub over HTTPS. With GCM, We don't have to manually create and store a PAT, as GCM manages authentication on your behalf, including 2FA (two-factor authentication).

**gitmore files**

.gitignore files would be used in implentation of source control to avoid certain updates. Completely experimental features would remain excluded unitl it is tested in hotfix and devOps sequentially in their respective submission repository before inclusion can be considered. This is implemented through gitmore. Project 1 excludes this due to simplicity in code design then further in more complex structure as in project 2 C++. This would come in handy to avoid automated additions
